# T2 Engine Reimplementation

## Running

When either running main.py directly or a built executable, it will expect a ```--gamedata``` parameter if the executable currently does not reside
in the GameData directory of a working Tribes 2 installation.

## Building

```bash
python3 setup.py bdist_apps
```

See https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/distribution/setuptools-examples for more information.
